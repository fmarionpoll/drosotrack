## DrosoTrack Pages

DrosTrack is a repository for Java routines used to build plugins to run under Icy (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/), which is a free image analysis system derived from ImageJ and developed at Institut Pasteur.

### Features

This release includes 2 plugins associated with a dialog box and 2 tools without a dialog

```markdown
Plugins with dialog:
- DrosoTrack -track individual flies with an algorithm based upon a simple threshold and save results to an Excel file
- CapillaryTrack - define capillaries positions, build corresponding kymographs and track their liquid level + export to Excel file

Plugins with no dialog:
- drosoSequence - define sequence of stacks of images which are only partly loaded into memory
- drosoTools - utility methods used by plugins with dialogs
```
